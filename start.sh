# One-command boot for the self-hosted docker stack. Safe to re-run any
# time - every step checks before it writes. Quickstart:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/NeoZi12/dispatchseo && cd dispatchseo && sh start.sh
#
# What it does: creates .env from the example on first run, generates the
# one required secret, picks a free host port (4005, or the next port up
# if something like a dev server already holds it), then docker compose
# up. Full guide: docs/SELF_HOSTING.md
set -e

# start.sh is also the upgrade command, and the stack is not only images:
# docker-compose.yml, setup.sql (the migrate container mounts it from this
# folder), and this script itself all live in the repo. Refresh the repo
# first, then hand off to the fresh copy of this script (exec, so a changed
# start.sh never runs half-old half-new). Forks with local commits, tarball
# installs, and offline machines fail the ff-only pull quietly and boot
# what they have; GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 keeps a credential prompt from
# hanging an unattended run.

# No git clone here (the tarball path install.sh takes when git is absent).
# Say so LOUDLY, because the image pull further down is NOT gated on this:
# without it, an upgrade quietly lands the newest app + builder images on
# whatever setup.sql and docker-compose.yml this folder was created with -
# so new migrations never apply and new compose env never reaches the
# containers. Nothing errors; features just silently don't exist, while
# docs/upgrading.mdx promises "sh start.sh is the whole upgrade". A warning
# that names the real command is the least this can do.
