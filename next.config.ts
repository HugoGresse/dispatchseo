  // and a redeploy of the README. Same pattern Postiz (discord.postiz.com) and
  // Immich (discord.immich.app) use, on a path rather than a subdomain because
  // we already own the app and a path costs no DNS.
  //
  // permanent: false is load-bearing. A 308 is cached by the browser forever,
  // so the day the invite code changes, everyone who ever clicked the old one
  // keeps being sent to a dead invite - which is exactly the failure this
  // indirection exists to prevent. 307 keeps the redirect ours to change.
  // (Postiz ships a 301 here; Immich ships a 307. Immich is right.)

  // paths hit the dashboard auth gate and bounce to /login, and next.config
  // redirects resolve ahead of that.

// Sentry is wrapped ONLY when a DSN is configured. Left on unconditionally the
// plugin still rewrites the client bundle and warns about the missing auth
// token on every self-hosted `docker compose up` build - noise about a service
// that install has not signed up for.
//
// This skips the PLUGIN, not the SDK: instrumentation-client.ts imports
// @sentry/nextjs statically, so ~65KB gzipped (measured) rides along in every
// build, DSN or not - it simply never initialises and never sends. Making that
// import lazy would drop the weight for self-hosters but would also miss the
// errors thrown before the chunk resolves, which are the ones worth having.
//
// tunnelRoute proxies browser events through /monitoring instead of straight to
// ingest.sentry.io, which ad blockers block by default - without it the errors
// most worth seeing (the ones hitting users who run uBlock) are the ones that
// never arrive. It is a build-injected rewrite, so /monitoring must also be
// allowlisted in src/proxy.ts or the gate 307s those POSTs to /login.
