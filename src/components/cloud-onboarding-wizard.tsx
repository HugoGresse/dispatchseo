// The cloud onboarding wizard - nine screens over a 5-step rail, of which
// any one owner walks six. Step 1 and step 2 each come in variants (connect a
// repo or a WordPress site; connect a coding agent, an agent without a repo,
// or the claude.ai app) because the answers are structural, not cosmetic - see
// wizard-branch.ts, which decides which pair this owner gets.
// Cloud drops everything self-host's wizard needs a terminal for: GitHub
// connects through the App (no token to paste), Claude Code needs one
// setup-token paste instead of a whole install command, and the pipeline
// installs itself server-side (runPipelineInstall) instead of the owner
// pasting an install command into their own Claude Code. Screen persistence
// (setWizardScreen) and the resume-on-reload pattern are copied verbatim
// from onboarding-wizard.tsx so the two wizards never drift on the basics.

// Nine screens, still five steps: c1/c1w are alternative step 1s (connect the
// site) and c2/c2a/c2c alternative step 2s (connect the AI). Nobody walks more
// than five, so the rail never grows - see wizard-branch.ts for which pair a
