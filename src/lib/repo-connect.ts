// Self-host: point a project at a (different) GitHub repo AFTER creation.
//
// Until 2026-08-06 the repo column was written exactly once, inside
// createProjectCore - set_github_repo and the wizard picker are both
// cloud-gated (they validate against a GitHub App installation self-host
// doesn't have), and Settings rendered the repo read-only. So a self-hoster
// who connected the wrong repo, or disconnected to fix one, was stranded
// with github_repo null and no supported way back (live incident: mia-tax
// pointed at the business's app repo instead of its website repo).
//
// Validation mirrors connectGithubToken's checks, with the same tolerance
// as creation: when the instance merge token exists it must be able to SEE
// the repo and READ its code (builds clone it), with the same guidance
// wording; when no token is stored yet the write is accepted on format
// alone - exactly what creation does, because the merge-token step is where
// reachability becomes checkable at all.
//
// Shared by the set_github_repo MCP tool's self-host branch and the
// Settings repo row's server action (the parity rule). Cloud keeps its
// installation-validated paths - this function refuses to run there.
