// The third-site GitHub Actions cost gate.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Every site's automations run as GitHub Actions inside the
// owner's own repo, billed to the owner's own GitHub account - never to us,
// and never visible to us. GitHub's free allowance covers about two sites'
// worth of minutes. From the third, a private-repo owner who has left the
// default $0 spending limit in place does not get an invoice; GitHub simply
// PAUSES their workflows when the free minutes run out. Nothing publishes,
// nothing builds, and from inside the dashboard that is indistinguishable
// from DispatchSEO being broken. `githubQuotaAlert` (cron-alerts.ts) exists
// purely to guess at this after the fact, and its own comment admits the
// limitation: "we cannot see another account's billing page".
//
// So the honest fix is to ask BEFORE the third site exists, at the one moment
// the answer is actionable.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a verification. There is no GitHub API we can
// call with an installation token to read someone's spending limit, so this
// records an informed choice, not a confirmed fact. That is worth building
// anyway: the failure mode it prevents is an owner who never knew the question
// existed, and a decision made deliberately is the whole point.
//
// The one branch we CAN verify is public repos - GitHub gives public
// repositories unlimited free Actions minutes, so an owner whose repos are all
// public has no problem to be warned about, and gets no interruption.

 * Both non-public outcomes still keep the step up. Failing toward INFORMING is
 * right for a cost warning; the difference is only what we say.
