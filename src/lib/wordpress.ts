// The second publishing route. DispatchSEO's first (and until now only) way
// to land an article was a GitHub pull request - fine for a code-built site,
// impossible to explain to an owner who has never opened a terminal. Two paid
// WordPress trials died at exactly that step ("Connect GitHub") in 2026-08.
// This module is the fix: it talks to a self-hosted WordPress site over its
// own HTTP connection using an Application Password the owner copy-pastes
// from their own Users screen. No plugin to install, no OAuth app to approve
// - just a username and a password WordPress itself generates.
//
// Two mechanical decisions here are deliberate and NOT bugs to "fix" later:
//
// 1. We never create a post with status:"future". WordPress's own scheduler
//    (WP-Cron) only runs when a visitor loads a page, so a scheduled post on
//    a low-traffic site can sit unpublished long past its scheduled time -
//    WordPress's own documentation gives a 2pm-scheduled / 5pm-actually-live
//    example. Every post this module creates is a draft; DispatchSEO's own
//    cron calls publishPost() at the moment the owner actually wants it live.
//    If you are looking at this because a post published "late," the bug is
//    in the cron's timing, not here - do not reintroduce status:"future".
//
// 2. We never touch _elementor_data, or anything else Elementor-specific.
//    Elementor has said publicly there is no supported way to write their
//    page-builder data from outside the editor. A post created through the
//    plain `content` field renders fine through the theme's (or Elementor
//    Pro's) normal single-post template - it just isn't an Elementor-built
//    layout, which is the correct and only safe outcome here.
//
// Credentials (WordPressCredentials) arrive already decrypted - the caller
// owns src/lib/crypto.ts. Nothing in this module writes a password to a log,
// an error, or a returned message; every failure is described with our own
// fixed English sentences, never by echoing back what was sent.
//
// Every outbound call goes through wpFetch(), which mirrors the SSRF guard
// in src/lib/site-platform.ts: HTTPS is required, the host is checked against
// isPrivateHost() on the starting URL AND on every redirect hop (redirects are
// followed by hand, never with fetch's redirect:"follow"), every read is
// capped, and every call carries a timeout.
