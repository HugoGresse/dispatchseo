// The background work queue (migration 0056).
//
// Three things in the new article flow are too slow for an HTTP request and
// too important to drop: crawling a customer's site, turning an accepted draft
// into finished HTML, and flipping a WordPress draft live at the hour its
// owner chose. Each becomes a row here, and a cron drains them.
//
// The claim mechanism is lifted from serp_tasks (0042/dataforseo-tasks.ts)
// rather than invented, because that pattern is already carrying real traffic
// in this codebase and its failure modes are understood:
//
//   finished_at IS NULL           = still to do
//   claimed_at set, finished NULL = in flight
//   claimed_at older than the grace window = the worker died; take it back
//
// The database row IS the lock. No queue service, no new dependency, and no
// second source of truth about what is pending - which matters because the
// dashboard, the alert rails and the drain route all have to agree on the
// answer to "is anything stuck".
//
// WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO: it never runs the work. Handlers live with
// their feature (crawl next to the crawler, publish next to the publisher) and
// register themselves with the drain route. A queue that knows what its jobs
// mean becomes the place every feature reaches into, and then nothing can be
// changed without changing it.
