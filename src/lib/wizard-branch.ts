// Which wizard the cloud owner actually walks.
//
// Two facts decide it, and the pre-checkout qualifier already collected both:
// where finished articles go, and which AI writes them. A WordPress owner has
// no repo to install a pipeline into, and someone whose only AI is the
// claude.ai app has no terminal to paste a credential into - so sending either
// of them through "Connect GitHub" and "paste your agent token" is a dead end
// they pay for first. Two paid trials died exactly there in August 2026.
//
// These are pure functions in their own module ON PURPOSE: the wizard is a
// client component and the server action that validates its form both need the
// same answers, and anything importing db.ts or projects.ts here would drag
// the service-role key into the browser bundle. Same reasoning as
// qualifier-options.ts. NOTHING SERVER-ONLY MAY EVER BE IMPORTED HERE.
