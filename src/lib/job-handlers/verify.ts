// Confirms a published article is actually reachable - and, once it is, files
// it as a real page of the site.
//
// The first half exists because "we posted it" and "it is live" are different
// claims, and this product has a standing rule against reporting the first as
// if it were the second. A post can be created successfully and still not be
// visible: a caching layer that has not caught up, a plugin that holds new
// posts for moderation, a theme that does not list the post type, a permalink
// structure that puts it somewhere other than where the API said.
//
// THE SECOND HALF matters just as much. Until the page is logged, an article
// published this way is invisible to the rest of the product: rank tracking,
// the refresh loop, internal-link candidates and the "do not write this twice"
// corpus all read `pages`, and the queued idea that produced it would sit
// in_progress forever with nothing left to move it. A repo article built by
// the customer's own CI agent gets this from its log_page call - these two
// routes have no agent in the loop, so it happens here.
//
// ORDER IS DELIBERATE: log the page, close the idea, and only then mark the
// draft published. The status flip is what makes this job a no-op on re-run,
// so it goes last - a failure anywhere above it leaves the draft `finished`
// and the retry does the whole thing again. The page write is an upsert on
// (project_id, url), so repeating it costs nothing.
//
// TWO SHAPES OF WAITING. WordPress hands back the real permalink, so there is
// one URL and the only question is whether it serves yet - worth a retry, and
// the queue's own backoff (minutes) is the right clock. A pull request is a
// different kind of waiting: somebody has to merge it, then a deploy has to
// run, and the address is a GUESS the publisher derived from the repo layout.
// That needs hours and days, which the backoff ladder cannot express, so the
// repo branch RE-ARMS itself instead - it enqueues its own successor and
// returns normally, and each of those is a completed job rather than a failed
// one. The round suffix on the idempotency key is what lets the successor
// exist while the current job is still unfinished.
