// The repo half of the publish job: the article becomes a commit and a pull
// request in the owner's own repository.
//
// It sits beside the WordPress handler rather than inside it because the two
// share nothing but their trigger - one talks to a REST API on the customer's
// server, the other rewrites someone's git history - and the failure taxonomy
// is the only thing worth keeping identical:
//
//   no-content-dir  the owner has not told us where their articles live and we
//                   could not work it out. Their setup, not our breakage: park
//                   the draft, complete the job, and let the Drafts screen ask
//                   them (blockedReason spells out the Settings field).
//   no-token        a GitHub connection IS stored and would not resolve. That
//                   worked before, so it is a regression and stays loud.
//   github-error    GitHub had a bad minute. Throw, and let the queue back off.
//
// How long the article then waits is what the verify job is armed for, and the
// two delays below are the whole reason it re-arms itself: a merged PR is live
// within minutes, an unmerged one waits on a human who might be asleep, and
// the queue's own backoff tops out at sixteen minutes.
