// Reads a customer's site and stores what it learned.

// This is the half of the product that makes the "your AI writes it" model
// affordable. A chat app cannot read 150 pages of a site - it would blow the
// context budget of a $20 plan before writing a word, and on the coding-agent
// pipeline that same bulk reading was the measured cost driver. So the server
// crawls once, on a schedule, and the customer's AI reads a small digest.
//
// Two products come out of one crawl, deliberately stored apart:
//   digest          - the compact summary the customer's AI reads
//   link_candidates - the full page list only our finisher reads
// See migration 0057 for why they are not the same column.
