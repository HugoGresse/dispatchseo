// The `blocked_setup` draft status, and the one rule that decides when a draft
// earns it.
//
// STATUS VOCABULARY (migration 0055 documents the rest):
//   submitted     their AI handed it in and it passed the gate
//   rejected      it failed the gate; the reasons are in `validation`
//   accepted      we rendered it; it is queued to go out
//   blocked_setup we rendered it, but this site has nowhere to publish it yet
//   finished      posted to WordPress, or pull request opened in the repo, not
//                 yet confirmed live
//   published     confirmed live by the verify job
//   discarded     the owner threw it away
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Onboarding deliberately leaves a project half-set-up: the
// owner can have their agent write an article before they have connected
// anywhere to publish it. If the finish or publish handler threw for that, a
// normal state in the middle of setup would burn five retries, turn the jobs
// cron red, put a banner on the dashboard and email the owner - for something
// that is not broken and that only they can complete. So a draft that has
// nowhere to go stops here quietly and shows up as a setup card instead.
//
// The line this must never cross: a connection that HAS worked and now fails
// is a regression and stays loud. That split is made by the callers, and it
// hangs on one fact - whether a credential was ever stored - not on whether
// the current attempt worked.
//
// NO REASON IS STORED WITH THE ROW, on purpose. The reason is always derivable
// from the project's connection state, and a stored one goes stale the moment
// the owner fixes it: a draft blocked yesterday for "no WordPress" would still
// say so today, after they connected. `blockedReason` recomputes it instead.
