// GitHub App installation ids are small sequential integers - trivially
// enumerable. Before binding one to a project, refuse any installation that
// is already attached to a DIFFERENT owner's project: without this, a
// signed-in attacker could claim another customer's installation and then
// commit files, write secrets, and dispatch workflows into the victim's
// repo through our App. (Residual: a never-yet-attached installation can't
// be bound to an owner this way - GitHub's setup redirect is unsigned and
// we hold no GitHub user identity - but the victim's own callback then
// fails loudly on this same check instead of silently sharing the repo.)
// A GitHub App installation is per ACCOUNT, but we store its id per PROJECT,
// so a strict "already bound anywhere = refuse" reading locks an owner out of
// connecting their SECOND site on the same GitHub account - and leaves the
// reconnect card unclearable, because every retry hits this throw
// (2026-07-29). Two escapes, both narrower than the risk this guards:
//   provenCaller - the OAuth code exchange confirmed this human administers
//                  the installation, which is strictly stronger evidence than
//                  "nobody else claimed it first";
//   already mine - a project the caller owns is bound to the same
//                  installation, so the binding was already established
//                  through this same check. Sharing it with another of their
//                  own projects escalates nothing.
