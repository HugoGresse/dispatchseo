// Publishing an article into the customer's own Git repository - from our
// server, not from an agent in their CI.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The repo route used to mean "a coding agent inside your
// GitHub Actions writes the file and opens the PR". That is fine for an owner
// who runs Claude Code or Codex, and a dead end for the owner whose AI is a
// chat app: they have a repo, they have an article, and nothing in between.
// So the server does the mechanical half itself - commit the markdown on a
// branch, open a pull request, merge it when the project is on Auto - and the
// verify job confirms the page afterwards, exactly as it does for WordPress.
//
// THE HARD PART IS NOT GIT, IT IS FITTING IN. Every static-site generator
// invents its own frontmatter: Astro wants `pubDate` and `heroImage`, Hugo
// wants `date` and `draft`, Jekyll wants `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-name.md` and a
// `layout`. Committing OUR shape into THEIR repo means a build that fails on
// a missing required field, which for the owner reads as "DispatchSEO broke my
// site". So we read a file that is already there and mirror it: the same key
// names, the same date format, the same file naming. It is imitation rather
// than configuration, because the owner should not have to describe their
// build system to us before their first article can ship.
//
// The pure helpers below (scoring, frontmatter, naming, URL prediction) are
// exported separately from the orchestrator so they can be exercised without a
// GitHub token - they carry all of the guessing, and guessing is what needs
// checking.
