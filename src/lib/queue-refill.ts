// Queue-empty self-heal (2026-07-27 incident).
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG: research is a fixed weekly cron with no buffer. A batch
// queues 7 guides, the daily builder consumes exactly one a day, so the queue
// hits zero on day 7 - and on restock day GitHub's scheduler dropped the 06:23
// trigger, so the 13:23 retry landed at 15:57, 47 minutes AFTER the last build
// window that could have used it. Both seo-daily attempts that day found an
// empty queue and exited "success" in 26 seconds. Nothing failed; nothing
// published either. Scheduler drift makes the ordering non-deterministic, so
// it recurs on its own.
//
// THE FIX: stop treating "the queue is empty" as a terminal state the builder
// shrugs at, and make it a TRIGGER. This sweep runs from the hourly-gsc cron
// (the most frequent backend heartbeat, where recoverStuckBuilds already
// lives) and fires the research workflow for any project whose guide queue has
// genuinely run dry.
//
// WHY THE BACKEND AND NOT seo-daily: the same reason /api/builder/jobs owns
// cadence - scheduling brains belong here, where a fix ships as a deploy
// instead of "every customer must take a new pipeline pack". It also makes the
// behavior identical for every tenant (listProjects), including ones whose
// pack is a version behind.

// How long to wait before firing a second refill at the same project. Sized
// well past a research run's own duration (~10-30 min) plus the build window
// it feeds, so a project that legitimately researches and STILL ends dry - a
// semi-mode owner rejecting everything, a niche with nothing left to find -
// gets one nudge a day, not one every heartbeat.

// leave ideas pending ON PURPOSE for the owner to decide, so an empty APPROVED
// queue with ten pending ideas is not a dry queue - it is a queue waiting on a
// human. Re-researching there would burn a Claude run and DataForSEO spend to
// pile more ideas on top of the ones already awaiting judgment.

  // exists to hold, so it must not depend on a display-scoping rule.

  // bare row belongs to whoever reported it - counting it would let one
  // tenant's research suppress every other tenant's refill for the rest of the
