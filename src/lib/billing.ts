// planGate's verdict for every project at once, as a set of SLUGS - the shape

// not project ids.
//
// Why this exists. planGate stops the WORK when a plan lapses: crons skip the
// project, the scheduler never dispatches a build, DataForSEO is never called.
// It never stopped the NOISE, and the noise has its own engine - the customer's
// own repo keeps its GitHub-side schedules (the daily health check, the
// builders' dead-man's crons, the auto-merge sweep), which run on GitHub's
// clock, not ours, and phone their outcomes home. So an account that stopped
// paying kept filing failure rows, kept lighting the Home banner, and kept
// emailing - the operator AND the ex-customer - about a pipeline it was no
// longer entitled to have running. Maxpertise's trial lapsed and its dead
// Claude credential mailed the operator every morning for a week
// (2026-08-11). A plan that has stopped buying the work has stopped buying
// the alerting about it too.
//
// Computed in two queries and joined in memory rather than calling planGate
// per job: getCronHealth runs on every dashboard render and once per project
// inside the schedulers, and planGate costs three round-trips each time.
//
// FAILS OPEN in every direction - self-host, unconfigured billing, ownerless
// projects, any query error - and the asymmetry is deliberate: a wrong "paused"
// silences a PAYING customer's broken pipeline, which is far more expensive
// than one stray email about a lapsed one.
