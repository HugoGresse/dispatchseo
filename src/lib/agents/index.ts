// The coding-agent registry - the single place that answers "which agent, and
// what does that imply".
//
// DispatchSEO drives a coding agent: it researches, writes, and opens PRs,
// while this backend is its state, schedule, and dashboard. That agent was
// Claude Code everywhere, hardcoded across the CI workflow templates, the
// docker builder, setup.sh, the connect commands, and the instructions. Adding
// a second agent means every one of those has to ask the same question in the
// same place instead of assuming an answer.
//
// It landed with ONE agent registered so the seam could be proven
// byte-identical to the hardcoded path before a second agent existed. Codex is
// now the second, and that guarantee did not lapse: scripts/agent-golden.mjs
// still diffs every Claude string on every push, and the Claude block of
// test/golden/agent-commands.json is unchanged since the day it was written.
// See docs-private/CODEX_SUPPORT_PLAN.md.
//
// Adding a third agent is one object in this file - plus its golden entry, so a
// later refactor cannot quietly rewrite a command someone pastes into a
// terminal. docs/AGENTS.md is the contributor-facing version of that bar.
//
// CLIENT-SAFE. The onboarding wizard builds connect commands in the browser, so
// nothing here may import db.ts, github-app.ts, or any server-only module -
// same constraint mcp-connect.ts documents.
