// The server-side quality gate for AI-written articles.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the product is moving to a model where the CUSTOMER'S
// OWN coding agent or chat AI writes the article - their ChatGPT Plus, Claude
// Pro, Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor. Those clients are wildly inconsistent: a
// chat app skips half a playbook a coding agent follows exactly, a cheap model
// leaves in "as an AI, I cannot..." boilerplate, a rushed run pastes the whole
// draft inside a code fence instead of writing the article. If quality depended
// on which client showed up, we could not promise a ChatGPT user the same
// standard as a Claude Code user. So quality is enforced HERE, once, identically,
// no matter who submitted the draft.
//
// This module is intentionally a closed box: pure functions only, no fetch, no
// database, no env vars, nothing async. Every fact it needs is passed in via
// `submission` and `context`. That is what makes it cheap to call on every
// submission (including every retry) and trivial to unit test with plain
// objects - no mocking, no network, no flakiness.
//
// THE "fix" FIELD IS THE PRODUCT. Every failing check writes its `fix` string
// to be read by the AI that submitted the draft, not by a human. It has to
// name the exact thing to change and the exact target ("expand X to at least N
// words"), because a rejection that just says "word count too low" costs the
// customer's own AI quota on a whole extra round trip to guess what "better"
// means. Vague fixes are a bug in this file, not a style nit.
//
// EXTENDING THIS FILE: every check is one entry in the `defs` array inside
// validateArticle(). To add a check, add one object with an `id`, a
// `severity`, and a `run()` that returns { passed, title, detail, fix }. Never
// scatter validation logic outside that array - the whole point is that the
// full rulebook lives in one place a reviewer can read top to bottom.

  // lesson is that the next one will not be spotted by reading either - so the
  // input itself is bounded, which caps the damage from whatever is found
  // next. 200,000 characters is roughly 30,000 words: an order of magnitude
  // past the longest article this product would ever want, so no real
  // submission can hit it, and anything that does is a bug or an accident
