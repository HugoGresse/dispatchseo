// what kind of site it is, and which AI will drive it. Both are structural -
// a WordPress site has no repo to open a pull request against, and an owner
// with no coding agent has nothing to run the builder - so both were already
// deciding who churns. They were just being asked five minutes too late, on a
// wizard screen that sits past checkout.
//
// Since 2026-08-20 the site question is a CHOICE (WordPress, or built with
// code on GitHub) with the domain optional beside it. The owner's answer is
// what the wizard branches on; the domain probe is the safety net - it still
// refuses a Wix/Squarespace/... site behind a confident click, and it still
// tells them what we saw.
