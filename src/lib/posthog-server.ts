// Server-side PostHog for Next.js App Router server actions/route handlers:
// short-lived functions need flushAt/flushInterval at their minimum and an
// explicit _shutdown() per call so a queued event isn't lost when the
// function exits before the batched flush would have fired (the plain
// `shutdown()` on this SDK version is a sync, fire-and-forget compat shim -
// `_shutdown()` is the one that actually returns the flush promise). Returns
// null when no token is configured (self-host installs that haven't opted
// into their own PostHog project), so every export below silently no-ops.

// Analytics must never be able to fail the thing it is only watching. Every
// call below runs AFTER the real work has committed - a subscription written,
// a session created, a checkout opened - and each is awaited by its caller, so
// a rejection here surfaces as that operation failing.
//
// The SDK's _shutdown() is a Promise.race that REJECTS on its own timeout
// (plain network errors it swallows, but a slow PostHog rejects, after burning
// 30 seconds of function budget first). That put a third party's bad minute in
// front of the Polar webhook - which answers non-2xx, gets retried, and after
// ten of those Polar disables the webhook for every customer - and in front of
// the auth callback, where it would bounce a correctly-signed-in user to
// /login?error=1. One wrapper closes all 20 call sites.
