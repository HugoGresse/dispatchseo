// The "finisher": turns an article a CUSTOMER'S AI wrote in markdown into a
// page ready to publish. This is the last module that touches an article
// before it reaches the site's actual database/CMS/repo - src/lib/wordpress.ts
// posts finishArticle()'s `html` straight into WordPress's `content` field,
// and a repo-publish path commits toMdx()'s output straight into the
// customer's repo. Nothing downstream re-escapes or re-sanitizes anything
// this file produces, so this is the one place that has to get it right.
//
// WHERE THIS SITS: the customer's own coding agent or chat AI writes markdown
// and submits it -> article-validate.ts gates it (word count, heading
// structure, placeholder text, fabricated sources, keyword stuffing - see
// that file) -> THIS module renders the validated markdown to publish-ready
// HTML, inserts a handful of internal links, builds an excerpt and a JSON-LD
// schema object -> wordpress.ts (or a GitHub PR carrying toMdx()'s output)
// actually lands it in front of a reader.
//
// THE SECURITY DESIGN, AND WHY IT IS NOT A COMPROMISE:
// There is no markdown-to-HTML library reachable from this module (see the
// dependency note below), so markdown parsing is hand-written. The obvious
// alternative - accept the model's own HTML, then sanitize it with an
// allowlist library afterward - is the shape that keeps producing XSS bugs
// industry-wide, because a sanitizer's allowlist is a moving target and this
// module's input is TEXT WRITTEN BY A LANGUAGE MODEL: for security purposes
// that is exactly as untrusted as a stranger's pull request, regardless of
// how well-behaved the model usually is. Sanitize-after is a blocklist
// wearing an allowlist's clothes.
//
// So the design here inverts it: HTML-ESCAPE THE ENTIRE MARKDOWN SOURCE FIRST
// - every &, <, >, ", ' becomes its entity, once, before any structural
// parsing happens - and every tag that ends up in the output (every <p>,
// <a>, <strong>, <code>, ...) is one this file itself writes, from a fixed
// set of template strings, never from a byte the model supplied. A literal
// "<script>" typed by the model is never treated as a tag; by the time any
// block/inline parsing sees it, it is already the three-and-a-bit escaped
// characters "&lt;script&gt;", which render as harmless visible text. There
// is no allowlist to keep in sync and nothing for a clever prompt to smuggle
// past, because nothing downstream of that first escape can ever introduce a
// real "<" or ">" into the output except this file's own template strings.
//
// DO NOT "fix" this later by adding HTML passthrough for the model's markup.
// The moment this module accepts and re-emits HTML from the markdown source,
// it reopens exactly the sanitizer-allowlist problem this design exists to
// avoid. "Customers publish an article they didn't type character-for-
// character" is the whole point of the product, not a reason to relax this.
//
// === NO NEW NPM DEPENDENCIES ===
// package.json has no markdown-to-HTML library reachable from this module
// (remark-gfm is present but its unified/remark-parse peers are not, and
// pnpm's strict node_modules layout means a transitive package is not
// importable just because some other dependency happens to pull it in).
// Every parser below is hand-written by design, not as a stopgap.
//
// SCOPE: this module supports the markdown subset the playbook actually
// produces - ATX headings, paragraphs, bold/italic/inline code, fenced code
// blocks, unordered/ordered lists with one level of nesting, blockquotes,
// GFM tables with alignment, horizontal rules, links, and images. Anything
// else in the source (setext headings, reference-style links, footnotes,
// raw HTML, strikethrough, ...) was never a structural element to begin with
// once the initial escape has run - it is just text, and it renders as
// exactly that: visible, harmless, and never silently dropped.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE COMPOSITION LIMIT, DOCUMENTED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: bold and
// italic markers that fall *inside* a link's visible text or an image's alt
// text are not further interpreted (they show up as literal ** or _
// characters inside the anchor/alt text). A real recursive-descent inline
// parser could compose these; this hand-written one is a single ordered pass
// per text run (code, then images, then links, then bold, then italic), and
// a bolded link is not a shape this playbook's own prose produces in
// practice. Write link/image text as plain text.
//
// REDOS: article-validate.ts, this module's upstream gate, already shipped
// one catastrophic-backtracking regex (a GFM table separator pattern that
// took 15 seconds on 3000 dashes) before it was rewritten as a linear scan -
// see that file's hasTable() comment. Every block-level scanner in this file
// follows the same discipline: anchored, single-quantifier regexes, or a
// plain character/line scan instead of a regex at all (isHr, splitTableRow,
// findWholeWordMatch all avoid regex entirely). The one pattern that could
// look suspicious at a glance - firstSentence()'s lazy `.*?[.!?]` - is a
// single, non-nested lazy quantifier anchored at the start of the string,
// which is linear-time (it is not the "(a+)+"-shaped ambiguity that causes
// blowups); it was hand-tested against a multi-KB string with no sentence
// punctuation at all and stayed sub-millisecond.
//
// PURE MODULE: no fetch, no fs, no env vars, no Date.now(), no React/JSX, no
// browser APIs. Every fact this file needs (the site's own URL, publish
// dates, the page inventory to link into) comes in as an argument - same
// discipline as article-validate.ts, and for the same reason: cheap to call
// on every retry, trivial to unit test with plain objects.

// a previous feature already produced (this is what "emphasis must not run

// resolved back to real HTML recursively at the very end, so a token that
// itself contains an earlier token (code nested inside a link's visible
// text, say) still comes out fully resolved.

// U+0000 (NUL) can never appear in real prose, and escapeHtml() never
// produces it either (it only ever emits ASCII entities), so it is a safe,
// unambiguous sentinel to wrap a placeholder index in - unlike, say, a
// plain " N " token, which a real sentence containing a number ("the plan
// costs 5 dollars") could collide with. Built via String.fromCharCode()
// rather than a source-level escape so the sentinel is a real NUL only at

 * a heading (h1-h6), inline/block code, or an existing <a> - those text
 * nodes are marked ineligible and never searched. When a match is found

 * buildSchema returns the graph as an object, and for a long time nothing
 * turned it into anything: finishArticle handed back a `schema` field that its
 * only caller never read, so every article published through this pipeline
 * went out with no structured data at all. Caught on 2026-08-19 by the first
 * end-to-end publish against a real site, which is exactly the class of thing
 * only a real publish finds - every unit-level check passed, because the
 * object it produced was correct. It was simply thrown away.
 *
 * The escaping is not optional. `JSON.stringify` will happily emit the
 * characters `</script>` if any string in the graph contains them - an article
 * title, a FAQ answer - and the browser ends the script block there and treats
 * the rest as markup. Escaping the three characters that can start a tag or an
 * entity closes that without touching what the JSON means, since a JSON parser
 * reads \u003c and `<` identically.
