//
// STRUCTURE IS LOAD-BEARING. This document is written to satisfy, in one pass:
//   - GDPR Art. 13 (the full mandatory-disclosure checklist: controller
//     identity, purposes AND legal basis, recipients, transfers, retention,
//     the complete rights list, whether provision is required, automated
//     decision-making). Missing any one of those is the finding a regulator
//     writes up first.
//   - Israeli Privacy Protection Law s.11 as amended by Amendment 13 (in force
//     2025-08-14): voluntary-vs-required, purpose, controller identity,
//     recipients, and the s.13-14 review/correct rights.
//   - Google API Services User Data Policy, incl. the verbatim Limited Use
//     sentence Google's reviewers grep for.
//
// EVERY FACTUAL CLAIM HERE WAS VERIFIED AGAINST THE CODE on 2026-08-02. If you
// change what the product collects, sends, or deletes, this page is part of
// that change - an inaccurate privacy policy is worse than a thin one, because
// it converts an engineering detail into a misrepresentation.

        <p>
          DispatchSEO is an SEO tool that researches keywords for your website, drafts articles
          and interactive tools as pull requests to your repository, and tracks how your pages
          rank in search.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hosted service at dispatchseo.com is operated by <Term>{OPERATOR}</Term>, an
          individual based in Israel, who is the <Term>data controller</Term> for the personal
          data described below. You can reach us about anything on this page at{" "}

        <p>
          DispatchSEO is also open source (AGPL-3.0) and can be self-hosted. If you run it
          yourself, your data lives entirely in your own accounts - your own hosting, your own
          database, your own Google Cloud project - and we are not the controller of it. The
          only thing a self-hosted install sends us is the install count described below. This

      <Section title="What we collect, why, and on what legal basis">
        <p>
          Providing this data is voluntary, but most of it is necessary to give you the
          service: without an email address we cannot create your account, and without a
          connected site we have nothing to work on. Where a field is optional, not providing
          it simply means the related feature does not run.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Account data.</Term> Your email address and, if you sign in with Google, the
          basic profile Google shares for sign-in (name, email, avatar). Signing in never
          asks for access to your Google data - that is a separate, optional consent described
          further down. We use this to run your account and to send service messages such as
          setup and failure alerts. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> performance of our contract with
          you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Billing data.</Term> Payments are handled by Polar as merchant of record. Your
          card details go to Polar and its payment processor and never reach us. We store your
          plan, subscription status, and Polar customer reference so the service knows what
          your account includes. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> performance of our contract, and our
          legal obligation to keep tax and accounting records.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Site and integration data.</Term> What you connect and what the service
          produces: your site&apos;s domain and repository name, tracked keywords, rank history,
          generated article and tool records, backlink prospects, and the credentials you
          provide - a GitHub token, DataForSEO or SerpApi credentials, a coding-agent token.
          Credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. <Term>Legal basis:</Term>{" "}
          performance of our contract with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Google Search Console data.</Term> If you connect Search Console, DispatchSEO
          requests read-only access (the <code>webmasters.readonly</code> scope and nothing
          else). It reads your properties list and search analytics: queries, clicks,
          impressions, and average positions. It cannot modify anything in your Google account.
          The OAuth refresh token is encrypted (AES-256-GCM) and deleted the moment you
          disconnect. Statistics derived from this data are stored per site to power rank
          tracking and reporting. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> your consent, given on Google&apos;s
          consent screen, which you can withdraw at any time by disconnecting.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Feedback you submit.</Term> If you post on the feedback board we store the
          title and body you wrote, your vote records, and your email address so we can reply.
          Your email is never displayed on the board. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> our legitimate
          interest in running a support and product-feedback channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Security and anti-abuse data.</Term> We store the IP address of failed login
          attempts and of waitlist signups, with a counter, to rate-limit brute-force and spam
          attempts. Failed-login records are deleted when you next sign in successfully.{" "}
          <Term>Legal basis:</Term> our legitimate interest in keeping accounts secure, and our
          obligation under GDPR Art. 32 to secure the service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Product analytics and error reports.</Term> We use PostHog to understand how the
          product is used and Sentry to be told when it breaks. What these collect, and how to
          say no, is set out under Cookies and analytics below.
        </p>

        <p>
          <Term>Self-hosted install count.</Term> If you run DispatchSEO yourself, your install
          sends us two things once a day: a random identifier generated on your own machine at
          first boot, and the version you are running. That is the whole payload - no domain,
          no email, no keywords, no site or Search Console data, no credentials, and the
          identifier is not derived from any of them. As with any HTTP request, the connecting
          IP address is visible to us and to our host in transit; we do not store it against
          the install record. It exists so we can tell how many installs are actually running,
          which download counts cannot answer. Turn it off by setting{" "}
          <code>DISPATCHSEO_TELEMETRY=off</code> in your <code>.env</code>; nothing else about
          the software changes when you do. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> our legitimate interest in
          knowing the size of the user base, balanced against a payload deliberately built to
          identify nobody.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not make any decision that produces a legal or similarly significant effect
          about you by automated means, and we do not profile you. We do not sell your personal
          data, and we do not share it for advertising or cross-context behavioural
          advertising.

          There are no advertising cookies, no ad-network pixels, and no cross-site tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Term>PostHog.</Term> In your browser, PostHog records page views, clicks and other
          interactions in the product, and session recordings of dashboard use. Once you are
          signed in we associate that record with your user id and email so we can tell which
          account hit a problem. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> your consent. We ask on your first
          visit, and until you accept, PostHog does not load at all - no cookie, no recording,
          nothing read from your device. Declining changes nothing else about the product, and
          you can change your mind by clearing this site&apos;s data in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Separately, our servers send PostHog a short record of a few significant events -
          an account created, a checkout opened, a site added or deleted - so we can tell
          whether the product is working. These are sent from our side, store nothing on your
          device and read nothing from it, and happen whether or not you accepted the cookies
          above. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> our legitimate interest in understanding whether the
          service functions, balanced against a record that is a handful of events per account
          rather than a picture of your behaviour. You can object to this at {CONTACT}.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Term>Sentry.</Term> When something errors we send Sentry a stack trace and the
          technical context of the request - the route, the browser, the error itself. Sentry
          is configured not to attach IP addresses or cookies to those reports, and we do not
          record sessions with it. <Term>Legal basis:</Term> our legitimate interest in finding
          out that the product is broken before you have to tell us.

      <Section title="Who else processes your data">
        <p>
          We use a small set of vendors to run the service. Each one processes data only on our
          instructions and only to provide its part of the service, under a data-processing
          agreement. The current list, with what each receives and where it runs, is on our{" "}
          <Link className="text-white underline" href="/subprocessors">
            subprocessors page
          </Link>
          , which we keep up to date as it changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We never sell your data, never share it for advertising, and never give it to anyone
          else except where this policy says so or where the law requires it - for example a
          binding court order, which we will tell you about unless we are forbidden from doing
          so.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Where your data lives and international transfers">
        <p>
          Both the application and the database that holds your data run in Frankfurt, in the
          European Union. We are established in Israel, which the European Commission
          recognises as providing an adequate level of data protection, so transfers from the
          EEA to us do not need any additional safeguard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our vendors are based in the United States. Where personal data reaches them,
          the transfer is covered by the European Commission&apos;s Standard Contractual
          Clauses, by the vendor&apos;s certification under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, or
          by another mechanism permitted under Chapter V of the GDPR. The{" "}

      </Section>

      <Section title="How long we keep it">
        <p>
          <Term>While your account is open:</Term> we keep your account data, your site data,
          and your rank and search history for as long as you have an account, because the
          history is the product - a rank chart with the old points deleted is not a rank
          chart.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Term>When you delete your account:</Term> your projects and everything attached to
          them - keywords, rank history, search statistics, pages, suggestions, backlink
          prospects, site profile - are deleted immediately, and your login is deleted with
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Term>What outlives that:</Term> billing and tax records, which Polar retains as
          merchant of record for the period its own legal obligations require; feedback-board
          posts, which stay on the board once the account that wrote them is gone, detached
          from it; and backups, which roll off on their own cycle within 30 days. Failed-login
          and waitlist rate-limit records hold an IP address until the counter next resets.
          Analytics and error records age out on PostHog&apos;s and Sentry&apos;s retention
          schedules, listed on the subprocessors page.

      <Section title="Security">
        <p>
          Traffic is encrypted in transit with TLS. Credentials and OAuth tokens are encrypted
          at rest with AES-256-GCM on top of whatever our database provider encrypts at the
          disk level. Every database table denies access by default - the database is
          unreachable except through server-side code holding a key that is never sent to a
          browser. Self-hosted dashboard passwords are hashed with scrypt; hosted accounts are
          held by Supabase Auth. Repeated failed logins lock an address out temporarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          No system is perfectly secure, and we do not claim otherwise. If a breach affects
          your personal data and is likely to result in a risk to your rights, we will notify
          the competent supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, and tell
          you directly where the law requires it. Security problems can be reported to{" "}

        <p>
          Concretely: Google user data is used only to recommend keywords and measure how your
          published content performs, both of which are features you see in the product. It is
          never used for advertising, never sold or transferred to data brokers, and never used
          to train generalised AI or machine-learning models. No human reads it except with
          your permission, for security purposes, or where the law requires it. If we ever
          change how we use it, we will ask for your consent again before the new use begins.

          The hosted service is for people aged 18 and over and is not directed at children. We
          do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18. If you believe a child
          has given us data, email {CONTACT} and we will delete it.

      <Section title="Changes">
        <p>
          Changes to this policy are published on this page with an updated effective date. If a
          change materially affects how we use data you have already given us, we will tell you
          before it takes effect - by email, or in the product - and, where the change relies on
          your consent, ask for it again. Because DispatchSEO is open source, the full revision
          history of this page is public in the repository.
