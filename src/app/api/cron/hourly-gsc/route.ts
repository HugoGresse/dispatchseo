// Hourly GSC refresh, triggered by the hourly-gsc GitHub Action (Vercel Hobby

// last few dates using dataState ALL, so today's provisional numbers flow into
// gsc_stats intraday and each trailing row converges to its final values as
// Google finalizes it. SERP rank checks stay on the daily cron only - ranks do
// not move hourly and the SERP calls are the paid part.

// 300, not the 60 this ran on until 2026-08-04. The inspection sweep below
// costs a network round trip per unindexed page, so the run time scales with
// how much each project has published - and once ClockedCode and DispatchSEO
// crossed ~6 unindexed pages each, a 48s run became a 60s timeout and every
// scheduled run 504'd. A timeout is the worst possible failure here: it kills
// the request before reportCronRun(), so the break never reaches cron_runs,
// the banner or the alert email, and recoverStuckBuilds + refillEmptyGuideQueues
// below never run either. Headroom is what keeps this loud when it does break.
