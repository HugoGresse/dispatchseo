// Receiver for the self-host heartbeat. The sender, the exact payload, and the
// opt-out all live in src/lib/heartbeat.ts - read that first.
//
// Public and unauthenticated on purpose. The callers are self-hosted installs
// running a public container image, so any credential this endpoint required
// would be sitting in that image for everyone to read - a shared secret here
// would buy nothing and would imply a guarantee it cannot make. What it does
// instead is validate shape and store nothing but shape: a UUID and a short
// version string, both discarded if they don't match. That bounds the damage
// from a stray curl to "someone can inflate an install count", which is a
// vanity metric, not a security boundary. Do not put anything behind this
// endpoint that a forged call could hurt.
//
// No /api/ path passes through the password gate in src/proxy.ts (it exempts
// /api/* wholesale so the MCP route and crons can carry their own bearer
// auth), so unlike a public PAGE this needs no allowlist entry.
//
// On a self-hosted install this route exists but does nothing: captureServer
// no-ops without a PostHog token, and self-hosts have none.
