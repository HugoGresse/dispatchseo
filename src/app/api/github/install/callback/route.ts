// GitHub redirects here after the App install/update flow. With "Request user
// authorization (OAuth) during installation" enabled, this URL is the App's
// "User authorization callback URL"; it is also set as the Setup URL, which
// only matters for the update redirect. (GitHub's docs say the Setup URL field
// is not even enterable once OAuth-on-install is ticked - an acknowledged gap
// in their own documentation. Pointing both at this route sidesteps it.)
//
// Three arrivals, and they do NOT resolve the same way:
//   setup_action=install  fresh install. Carries an OAuth `code`, plus our
//                         signed `state` when the flow began at our own
//                         /api/github/install/start. This is the only path
//                         that binds an installation to a project.
//   setup_action=update   repos added/removed from GitHub's settings UI.
//                         Carries NEITHER state NOR code - GitHub does not run
//                         the authorization step for an update - and needs no
//                         write. Handled first, below.
//   setup_action=request  org member asked an owner to approve. Nothing is
//                         installed yet and no code exists.
//
// state only comes back when the flow started at our own
// /api/github/install/start (the wizard's "Connect GitHub" button, which
// signs the originating project's slug into it) - a bare "Install" click
// from github.com/apps/... arrives with no state at all, so that path is
// handled separately below.
//
// getInstallation() is not optional plumbing: installation_id is a caller-
// supplied, unauthenticated query param at this point. Without checking it

// wired into their project.
