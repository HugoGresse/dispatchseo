// WHY IT IS ITS OWN PAGE. The privacy policy used to inline the vendor list,
// which meant every vendor change was an edit to the policy - so in practice
// the list went stale and PostHog and Sentry ran for months without appearing
// on it. A separate page is cheap to keep current, is what B2B procurement
// asks for by name, and is the thing GDPR Art. 28(2) expects you to be able to
// point at when you tell a customer who else touches their data.
//
// ADDING A VENDOR THAT TOUCHES CUSTOMER DATA MEANS ADDING A ROW HERE, in the
// same change. The DPA promises 30 days' notice before a new subprocessor
// starts, so the row goes up when the decision is made, not when it ships.
