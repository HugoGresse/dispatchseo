# DispatchSEO in-stack builder loop. Polls /api/builder/jobs on the app
# container, executes each returned job with a headless coding agent inside a
# clone of the site's repo, sweeps green guide PRs for auto-merge projects,
# and reports every outcome to the same cron_runs rails the dashboard
# banner and alert emails read. POSIX sh - keep it boring.
#
# WHICH AGENT is decided per JOB, by the backend, and arrives in the feed
# alongside the credential for it. The container never chooses - that is the
# same split the /api/builder/jobs header insists on, and it is what lets one
# stack host a Claude project and a Codex project at the same time.
#
# Env (set via docker-compose from .env):
#   CRON_SECRET              required - authenticates against the backend
#   CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN  optional - from `claude setup-token`
#   OPENAI_API_KEY           optional - from platform.openai.com/api-keys
#                            (at least one agent credential is needed to build;
#                             either can come from the dashboard instead)
#   BUILDER_GH_TOKEN         optional - overrides the wizard's merge token
#   APP_INTERNAL_URL         default http://app:3000
#   BUILDER_POLL_SECONDS     default 600 (the backend can lower/raise it)

# /dev/null and `|| true` ate the exit code, so a rejected report (e.g. the
# 40-char job-name cap that every long slug tripped) looked identical to a
# successful one. Still non-fatal by design - a logging failure must never kill

  # How Codex must write files here, prepended to every Codex prompt.
  #
  # Claude Code has built-in file tools. Codex, in `codex exec`, has the shell
  # and nothing else - `codex features list` reports apply_patch_freeform as
  # REMOVED, so there is no file-write tool to turn on. Left to itself the
  # model reaches for a heredoc, and the content this pipeline writes is MDX:
  # backticks everywhere, which bash expands as command substitution inside a
  # heredoc. On 2026-07-31 that failed every write for a whole run - it tried
  # heredocs, printf, base64 and reformatting the code fences, then gave up and
  # exited 0 with nothing built.
  #
  # So it is told, before the task, which methods survive quoting. Kept here
  # rather than in the shared playbook because it is not a content rule - it is
  # a fact about this container, and Claude must never be handed it.
  CODEX_FILE_RULE='ENVIRONMENT RULE (read first, it overrides habit): you have no apply_patch tool here - only the shell. NEVER write or edit a file with a heredoc, printf, or echo. The content is MDX and its backticks WILL be expanded by bash and corrupt the file or fail the command. Write files exactly one of two ways: (1) pipe an OpenAI-format patch envelope into the `apply_patch` command on PATH, or (2) python3 -c with the content read from stdin, never interpolated into the command string. Verify every write with `ls -l` and `head` before moving on, and never let a filename come from an unset shell variable. '
