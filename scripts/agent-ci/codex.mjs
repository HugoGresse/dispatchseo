  "ENVIRONMENT RULE (read first, it overrides habit): you have no apply_patch tool here - only the shell, and you are running UNATTENDED, so there is nobody to answer a question. Write every file with a SINGLE-QUOTED heredoc (cat > path <<'DSEOF' ... DSEOF) or with python3 reading the content from stdin. The quoted delimiter is the whole point: bash expands NOTHING inside it, so the backticks and $ in MDX and TSX survive verbatim. NEVER use an unquoted heredoc, printf or echo to write file content - an unquoted heredoc is what expands backticks and corrupts the file. Pick a delimiter that cannot appear in the content. Verify every write with ls -l and head before moving on, and never let a filename come from an unset shell variable. If you ever find yourself about to ask for approval or a go/no-go, do not: pick the safest option that still completes the task, do it, and say what you chose in the final report. A run that stops to ask a question builds nothing and is a failed run.";
